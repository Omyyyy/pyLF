# pyLF
LF Programming Language

Download and keep all files in the same directory with the same file and folder names as downloaded. Run 'py lf.py [filename].lf' to compile and run; use the 'tasks.json file' for a VSCode task that does this automatically. DO NOT MESS WITH THE FILE AND FOLDER NAMES AND PLEASE KEEP THEM IN THE SAME DIRECTORY.

# Syntax Highlighting

Drag and drop 'lf-syntax-highlighting' into your {USER}/.vscode/extensions to get syntax highlighting in VSCode.
